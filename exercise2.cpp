/*Create a class called AccountStore (shown in class diagram) to maintain an array of 
pointers to Account objects (from Exercise 1). Assume account store has a max capacity 
of 10 accounts to maintain. Provide public accessor methods to create account, get 
number of accounts, get account at index, and to delete the account from the account 
store. CreateAccount() and DeleteAt() functions should return the status true if 
accounts created or deleted and false otherwise.*/
