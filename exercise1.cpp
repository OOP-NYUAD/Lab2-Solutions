/* A class called Account, which models a bank account, is designed as shown in the class diagram. It contains:
    - Two private data members: accountNumber (int) and balance (double), which
      maintains the current account balance.
    - Public functions credit() and debit(), which adds or subtracts the given 
      amount from the balance, respectively. The debit() function shall print 
      "amount withdrawn exceeds the current balance!" if amount is more than 
      balance.
    - A public function print(), which shall print "A/C no: xxx Balance=xxxâ€œ 
    (e.g., A/C no: 991234 Balance=$88.88), with balance rounded to two decimal 
    places.
